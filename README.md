This project is the backend of an imaginary video rental app.
I made it when I took Mosh's Node.js course https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-complete-node-js-course

You can use Postman to verify the basic functionalites of this back end.
one simple command set was published on https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4549158/RzZ7o12j

procedure(hint)
1. send the "set user" post first to get the web token in the Header of the response  
2. add the token to the header of "set genre" post, then send the post.
3. use the "get genres" to read all genres in the database
